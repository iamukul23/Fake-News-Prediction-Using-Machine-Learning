üì∞ Fake News Prediction using Machine Learning
This project is a web application that predicts whether a news article is Fake or Real using machine learning. It uses Python for the backend (with Flask) and HTML/CSS for the frontend. The model is trained using Logistic Regression, TfidfVectorizer, and NLTK for text processing.
